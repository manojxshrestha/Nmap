# Nmap

Nmap is a network utility tool  which is used to enumerate hosts in the network , perform  reconnaissance or information gathering , vulnerability detection , exploitation and much more. 

# Host Discovery

Discovering the target host(s) is the first step towards network reconnaissance. There are multiple ways through which we can determine if the hosts are alive or not.

# Single IP Scan
To scan a single ip we simply give one ip as follows:

     sudo nmap -sn 192.168.254.10
     
     -sn means disable port scanning
